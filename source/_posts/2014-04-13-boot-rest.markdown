Here's a little sort of template toy project regarding contemporary JVM-based REST APIs powering HTML5/JS SPAs: <br>
<https://github.com/robi42/boot-rest>

Built with JDK 8, Spring Boot, Elasticsearch, Jersey 2, Gradle, Yeoman, Bootstrap, AngularJS, fun, and all that jazz...

PS: look 'ma, no XML! :)

Update (2015-05-04): now with ES6 a.k.a. ES 2015 via JSPM/SystemJS...
