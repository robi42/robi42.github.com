Here's a little sort of template toy project regarding contemporary JVM-based REST APIs powering HTML5/JS SPAs: <br>
<https://github.com/robi42/boot-rest>

Built with JDK 8, Spring Boot, Elasticsearch, Jersey 2, Gradle, Yeoman, Bootstrap, AngularJS, fun, and all that jazz...

PS: look 'ma, no XML! :)

Update 2015: now with ES6 a.k.a. ES 2015 via JSPM/SystemJS...

**Update 2016:** these days, "isomorphic" Redux/React is all the rage on the FE side of things...<br>
One may want to check out [Este.js](https://github.com/este/este) & co.<br>
On the BE, Spring Boot's playing nicely with Kotlin, and Spring MVC's favourable to JAX-RS, IMHO.
