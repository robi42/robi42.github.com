While having some years pretty packed with interesting and challenging work (see [CV](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/194129/cv_rthurnher.pdf)...), plus, quite something going on at the personal side of things (like marrying :) ) as well, I'm currently finally getting around to finishing my master's of computer science for good.

Here's the official thesis [topic proposal](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/194129/proposal.pdf) and the [research centre](http://www.cvast.tuwien.ac.at/cvast) where it's run.

To be continued (hopefully)... ;)
